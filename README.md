## 🖥️ Supported Platforms

- **Windows:** 10 or newer, 64-bit
- **Linux:** any modern distribution (Ubuntu, Debian, Linux Mint, etc.) supporting .deb packages or AppImage
- **macOS:** 11.0 (Big Sur) or newer, Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4), 64-bit, .dmg installer available

- **Disk space:** ~200 MB for the installer; ~550mb for the app; additional space needed for database files

## 🐘 PostgreSQL Support

Invoice Builder now supports **two database backends**:

| Storage Type            | Description                                                           | Best For                                           |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **SQLite (local file)** | Simple, portable, zero‑configuration database stored as a single file | Solo users, offline use, desktop mode              |
| **PostgreSQL (server)** | Network‑accessible database server with concurrency and robustness    | Multi‑user setups, Docker deployments, NAS/servers |

Users can now choose between:

- **Creating or opening a local SQLite database file**, or
- **Connecting to a PostgreSQL server** by entering host, port, username, password, and database name.

This makes Invoice Builder flexible for both lightweight personal use and more advanced multi‑device or multi‑user environments.

## 🧑‍💻 Self-Hosting (Docker)

Invoice Builder can also be self-hosted using Docker for users who prefer running it on their own server or NAS.

This option is ideal if you want:

- Centralized access from multiple machines
- Easy backups via mounted volumes

### Docker Image

You can build and deploy it manually via Docker Compose.

> **ℹ️ `VITE_API_URL` is no longer needed for Docker deployments.**
> The Docker image now uses **nginx** as the frontend server. Nginx proxies all `/api/*` requests
> to the backend internally, so the frontend never needs to know the backend's external address.
> `VITE_API_URL` is only needed when running the web server outside Docker (e.g. `npm run dev:react`, `npm run dev:webserver`).
>
> If you build the image yourself for non-Docker use, you can still pass it:
>
> ```bash
> docker build --build-arg VITE_API_URL=http://your-host:3000 -t invoice-builder .
> ```
>
> But for all standard Docker deployments you can omit it entirely.

---

### Option A – Two containers (recommended)

The default setup runs backend and frontend as separate containers from the same image.

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

| Container  | Port | Role                         |
| ---------- | ---- | ---------------------------- |
| `backend`  | 3000 | Node.js REST API + SQLite/PG |
| `frontend` | 3001 | Static SPA served by `serve` |

---

### Option B – Single container

Run both backend and frontend in one container using `SERVICE=all`:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.standalone.yml up -d
```

| Port | Role                         |
| ---- | ---------------------------- |
| 3000 | Node.js REST API + SQLite/PG |
| 3001 | Static SPA served by `serve` |

---

### Building locally instead of pulling

If you prefer to build the image from source:

```bash
# Two-container build
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose up -d

# Or single container
docker build -t invoice-builder .
docker compose -f docker-compose.standalone.yml up -d
```

## 📦 Installation

Download the latest release from the **GitHub Releases** page:

➡️ [Download Latest Release](https://github.com/piratuks/invoice-builder/releases)

No account required.

### Linux AppImage

Make the AppImage executable and launch it:

```bash
chmod +x Invoice-Builder-*.AppImage
./Invoice-Builder-*.AppImage
```

> ⚠️ **Browser download warning**
>
> When downloading the app, your browser may show a message like:
>
> - “This file is from an unknown source”
> - “This file is rarely downloaded”
>
> This is normal for newly published apps and does **not** indicate a security issue.  
> Simply choose **Keep anyway / Save anyway** to proceed with the download.
>
> 🐧 **Linux package warning**
>
> On some Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Linux Mint, etc.), you may see messages such as:
>
> - “This package is provided by a third party”
> - “Installing software from outside the official repositories may be unsafe”
>
> This warning appears because the app is not distributed via the default system repositories.  
> If you downloaded the package directly from the official GitHub Releases page, it is safe to proceed.
>
> 🍎 **macOS Gatekeeper warning**
>
> Because this app is **unsigned**, macOS may display a message like:
>
> - “App is damaged and can’t be opened. Move to Trash”
> - “App is from an unidentified developer”
>
> This happens because macOS Gatekeeper treats all unsigned apps downloaded from the internet as potentially unsafe.  
> It adds a special **quarantine flag** to the app bundle, which prevents it from launching.
>
> To fix this, after downloading and installing it:
>
> 1. Open **Terminal**.
> 2. Run the following command:
>
>    ```bash
>     sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Invoice Builder.app"
>    ```

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Launch the application
2. Create a new database file or open an existing one
3. Add at least:
   - a Layout
   - a Business
   - a Currency
   - a Client
   - a Bank
   - an Item
4. Create your first Invoice or Quote
5. Preview and export to PDF

## 📘 Tutorial

Detailed tutorials and usage guides are available here: [TUTORIAL](TUTORIAL.md)

Layout JSON structure and supported composition options are documented in [LAYOUT.md](LAYOUT.md).

## 🧠 Data Model & Snapshots

When an invoice or quote is created, snapshots of the following are stored with the document to ensure historical accuracy:

- **Bank**
- **Business**
- **Client**
- **Items**
- **Currency**
- **Style profile**
- **Layout**

Changes to these entities do **not** affect existing invoices or quotes.  
Snapshots are updated only when editing an invoice or quote and changing the associated **client, business, item, or currency**.

## 🔄 Backups & Data Portability

You can:

- **Back up and reopen** the full database file
- **Export all data to JSON** and import it back
- **Import and export layout JSON** files from the Layouts page
- **Export entities to XLSX** for manual editing
- **Import entities from XLSX**

> **Note:** Invoices and quotes are export-only to preserve historical data integrity.
